# Learn Jules with Jules Koans

The Koans walk you along the path to enlightenment in order to learn [Jules](https://github.com/deanius/jules). The goal is to learn the Jules library for musical combinatorics. But we also teach you being slow and methodical. Testing is not just something to pay lip service to, but something to live. It is essential in your quest to learn and do great things.

## Installing Node.js ##

In order to run the koans you need Node.js installed. If you do not already have Node.js set up, please visit the [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) site to install Node.js.

To verify your installation, in your terminal window simply type:
```bash
$ node --version
```
Any response for Node with a version number greater than 0.10.x is fine.
